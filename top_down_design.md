      - Ask if this seems feasible for you
    - Talk to people who were self-taught
      - Ask them if they would have done it differently
      - Ask about the hardest part of getting a job from being self-taught
        - Consider if you can overcome these types of challenges
  - Read about 4-year Computer Science programmers
    - Ask: Do I have this kind of time?
      - Answer: No
    - Ask: Do I have this kind of money?
      - Answer: No
  - Read about bootcamp graduates
    - Read blogs
    - Read forums asking "Is this bootcamp a good idea?"
    - Move past the website marketing to the outcomes data of graduates
    - Read both positive and negative reviews of accessible bootcamps
  - Research Turing
    - Go to a Try Coding weekend
      - Attend Saturday
        - Realize you haven't been in a real classroom in quite some time
        - Get a bit bored with the 101 nature of the class
      - Attend Sunday
        - Dig into what the program is beyond coding languages
    - Put off applying for at least another few months
      - Current job isn't so bad
      - Oh wait, a crushing feeling of stagnation has brought out the worst coping strategies, maybe start looking into applying?
